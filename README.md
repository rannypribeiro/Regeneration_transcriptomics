# Regeneration_transcriptomics
This repository contains resources from Ribeiro, RP; Ponz-Segrelles, G; Bleidorn, C &amp; Aguado MT (in prep) "Comparative transcriptomics of the regeneration in syllids (Annelida, Syllidae): epigamy and schizogamy show similar patterns"
## Contends of this repository
1. Assemblies, assemblies statistics and Transdecoder predicted proteins from the transcriptomes of two species: Sphaerosyllis hystrix and Syllis gracilis.
2. Folder DE_results: contains the results of functional enrichement of 'Trinity genes' resulted from differential expression analysis.
## Assemblies
Assemblies were splitted:
Sphaerosyllis hystrix: five files in Sphaerosyllis_hystrix-assembly.rar
Syllis gracilis: five files in Syllis_gracilis_assembly_part1.rar, and two files in Syllis_gracilis_assembly_part2.rar
## DE_resuls
The following codes were used for the experimental conditions:
